# U | Understand
A book inventory system for a library.

# C | Clue Detection
Book class:
    - ID
    - Title
    - Author
    - Checkouts
    - Due Date
    - Available
    - Genre

# A | Assemble
1) Create a Book.py file to create the Book class
2) Create a Main.py file and call the menu.
3) Create a Library.py file and store all book instances in a list.
4) Create a Functions.py (InventorySystem.py) file that contains the main program features/logic.

# S | Solve
The final solution has a Main.py file that calls a menu function. This menu function refrences other functions in the InventorySystem.py file that interact with data stored in Library.py. The data is a list containing instances of the Book class created in the Book.py file.

# E | Evaluate
1) Small bugs
2) Navigation: Returns -> While Loop
3) Data Persistence
4) UI
5) Search: For Loops -> ?
6) Unittest
